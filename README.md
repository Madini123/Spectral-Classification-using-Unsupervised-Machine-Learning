# Spectral-Classification-using-Unsupervised-Machine-Learning
Spectral Classification of Stars, Galaxies and QSO's using Unsupervised Machine Learning (K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering)

This project focuses on spectral classification of celestial objects using unsupervised machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of 15,000 spectra obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR16). The study applies clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques to classify spectra based on their intrinsic properties.
